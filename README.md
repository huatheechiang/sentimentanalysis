# Naive Bayes Sentiment Analysis 

This project aims to create a model that can accurately predict whether a review is positive or negative. When initally tested, the model had a 71.875% success rate.

The model was constructed using the Naive Bayes sentiment analysis classifier. The entire project is built in Python with some libraries such as regex and stemmer porter 

To run, provide a JSON file of "reviews" and "sentiments" to train the model as well as a JSON file of only "reviews" to test the model.
